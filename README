Typical Usage:

init_nmallocator() - call at the start of the program initialization, passing it the numa node
where memory should be allocated throughout the life of the program. Returns 0 on success,
check the return value of the call before proceeding with memory allocation.

nmalloc() - zeroed out memory is handed over to the caller for a successful allocation

nmfree() - user memory freed and zeroed out to prevent information leak
